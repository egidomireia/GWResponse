# GWResponse
This repository provides a full simulation setup for modeling the detector response of the LISA mission to gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences, focusing on the (2,2) mode. It uses the IMRPhenomD waveform model and implements the LISA response in JAX, following the formalism from arXiv:2003.00357.
